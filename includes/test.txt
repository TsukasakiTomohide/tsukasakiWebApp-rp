Ivonne Flores	iflores@hiokiusa.com	1	4	Submitted	 											VC2/VC3 SolutionsGoal would be to simplify tax process, but in the meantime, we (CS) can continue verifying taxes but cc (a Tax Controller (for a better outcome I suggest someone from AP)) ONLY with End User customers so in case there is there is any further information that needs clarification.What I can do in the meantime, double check Markups is up to date in case is not update customer classification have all or most of them complete and I know there has been some new ones lately confirm their class, too.	Annual GoalReduction and Sales Tax Errors	Goals of the quarter50%			VC2/VC3 SolutionsSomething helpful will be to reflect Markups updated information of representatives, ownership and commission in NetSuite. By doing this, it will help us decrease errors as will help save time and we can focus on specific points when processing the orders.On my part, I will be more careful when putting in the information and look for ways to help me get better. 	Annual GoalReduction in Errors when processing PO to SO	Goals of the quarter0 errors in Sales Order processing			VC2/VC3 SolutionsWe can give Distributor’s access just as the Web Store, they can process their orders online and as they will put in their email addresses when processing orders, NNR can send the tracking number directly to the customer but not only that they can also have access to check lead time in real time. See best way to accomplish this in a meeting with Imelda and Janus.	Annual GoalAutomated PO for Online Distributors	Goals of the quarterObtain a Mockup			VC2/VC3 SolutionsIf we cannot afford a new hired Tax Controller, have someone 1 or 2 people within the company, maybe (AP) or someone who already has some experience take a training to do just this, as it will be a time saver in the end. It will also improve communication as only 1 or 2 people would be involved, the less involved the faster it would get solved and customer will be happy.
